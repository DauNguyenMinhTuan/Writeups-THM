## Evaluation of Search Results

On the Internet, everyone can publish their writings. It can be in the form of blog posts, articles, or social media posts. It can be even in more subtle ways, such as by editing a public wiki page. This ability makes it possible for anyone to voice their unfounded claims.

It is our job, as readers, to evaluate the information. We will mention a few things to consider when evaluating information:
* **Source:** Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.
* **Evidence and Reasoning:** Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments. Objectivity and bias: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.
* **Corroboration and Consistency:** Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources agree on the central claims.

## Search Engines

Every one of us has used an Internet search engine; however, not everyone has tried to harness the full power of an Internet search engine. Almost every Internet search engine allows us to carry out advanced searches. Consider the following examples:
* Google
* Bing
* DuckDuckGo

Some search operators supported by Google:
* `"exact phrase"`: Double quotes indicate that we are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase.
* `site:`:This operator lets us specify the domain name to which we want to limit our search.
* `-`: The minus sign allows us to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase.
* `filetype:`: This search operator is indispensable for finding files instead of web pages. Some of the file types we can search for using Google are Portable Document Format (PDF), Microsoft Word Document (DOC), Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (XLS), and Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (PPT).

## Specialized Search Engines

### Shodan

Shodan, a search engine for devices connected to the Internet. It allows us to search for specific types and versions of servers, networking equipment, industrial control systems, and IoT devices.

### Censys

At first glance, Censys appears similar to Shodan. However, Shodan focuses on Internet-connected devices and systems, such as servers, routers, webcams, and IoT devices. Censys, on the other hand, focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets. Some of its use cases include enumerating domains in use, auditing open ports and services, and discovering rogue assets within a network.

### VirusTotal

VirusTotal is an online website that provides a virus-scanning service for files using multiple antivirus engines. It allows users to upload files or provide URLs to scan them against numerous antivirus engines and website scanners in a single operation. They can even input file hashes to check the results of previously uploaded files.

### Have I Been Pwned

Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) does one thing; it tells us if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach. Finding one's email within leaked data indicates leaked private information and, more importantly, passwords. Many users use the same password across multiple platforms, if one platform is breached, their password on other platforms is also exposed. Indeed, passwords are usually stored in encrypted format; however, many passwords are not that complex and can be recovered using a variety of attacks.

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

### CVE

We can think of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as a dictionary of vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products.

Each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID with a standardized format. This unique identifier (CVE ID) ensures that everyone from security researchers to vendors and IT professionals is referring to the same vulnerability.

### Exploit Database

There are many reasons why we would want to exploit a vulnerable application; one would be assessing a company's security as part of its red team. Needless to say, we should not try to exploit a vulnerable system unless we are given permission, usually via a legally binding agreement.

Now that we have permission to exploit a vulnerable system, we might need to find a working exploit code. One resource is the Exploit Database. The Exploit Database lists exploit codes from various authors; some of these exploit codes are tested and marked as verified.

### GitHub

GitHub, a web-based platform for software development, can contain many tools related to CVEs, along with proof-of-concept (PoC) and exploit codes.

## Technical Documentation

One vital skill to acquire is to look up official documentation.

### Linux Manual Pages

Long before the Internet was everywhere, how would we get help using a command in a Linux or Unix-like system? The answer would be checking the manual page, man page for short. On Linux and every Unix-like system, each command is expected to have a man page. In fact, man pages also exist for system calls, library functions, and even configuration files.

### Microsoft Windows

Microsoft provides an official Technical Documentation page for its products.

### Product Documentation

Every popular product is expected to have well-organized documentation. This documentation provides an official and reliable source of information about the product features and functions. Examples include Snort Official Documentation, Apache HTTP Server Documentation, PHP Documentation, and Node.js Documentation.

It is always rewarding to check the official documentation as it is the most up-to-date and offers the most complete product information.

## Social Media

There are billions of users registered on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. We are expected to be familiar with popular platforms.

Ideally, one would want to explore a platform without creating an account; however, this severely limits our experience. Instead, one recommendation is to use a temporary email address to discover these platforms without linking them to our real email addresses; once done, we can terminate the accounts and associated email addresses. One reason for not using our primary account is that we don't want our contacts to start connecting with us there when we are only temporarily exploring a platform.

The power of social media is that it allows us to connect with companies and people we are interested in. Furthermore, social media offers a wealth of information for cyber security professionals, whether they are searching for people or technical information.

When protecting a company, we should ensure that the people we protect are not oversharing on social media. Furthermore, as a cyber security professional, we want to stay updated with new cyber security trends, technologies, and products. Following the proper channels and groups can provide a suitable environment for growing our technical expertise.

Besides staying updated via social media channels and groups, we should mention news outlets. Hundreds of news websites would offer valuable cyber-security-related news.
