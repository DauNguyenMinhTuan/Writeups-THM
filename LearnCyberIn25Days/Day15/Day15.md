# 25 Days of Cyber Security

## [Day 15] [Scripting] There's a Python in my stocking!

* Category: Scripting
* Difficulty: **Easy**

### Challenge

This is a very basic Python challenge so let's rush through the questions.

> What's the output of True + True?  
> **Answer**: 2  
> *Explanation*: In Python, True is represented as 1. So True + True is equivalent to 1 + 1.

> What's the database for installing other peoples libraries called?  
> **Answer**: PyPi

> What is the output of bool("False")?  
> **Answer**: True  
> *Explanation*: The function bool() only returns False if the input is False, None, 0, or an empty sequence or mapping, otherwise it returns True. In this case, the input is a non-empty string, so the output is True.

> What library lets us download the HTML of a webpage?
> **Answer**: requests

> What is the output of the following code?
> ```
> x = [1,2,3]
> y = x
> y.append(6)
> print(x)
> ```  
> **Answer**: [1, 2, 3, 6]  
> *Explanation*: In Python, lists are mutable objects. When we assign a list to another variable, we are actually assigning a reference to the list. So, when we modify the list through one variable, the changes are reflected in the other variable as well.

> What causes the previous task to output that?  
> **Answer**: pass by reference
